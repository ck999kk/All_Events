## AUTHENTICATION CERTIFICATE

### DECLARATION OF AUTHENTICITY

I, **Chawakorn Kamnuansil**, declare that:

1. **Collection and Custody**: I am the originating party and custodian of the evidence documents stored in this repository, having collected and maintained these materials in the course of:
   - Residential tenancy dispute proceedings (VCAT Case R202518589_00 – Possession; VCAT Case R202518214_00 – Notice to Vacate Challenge)
   - Dispute Resolution and Compliance proceedings (County Court case RT252398 – Residential Tenancies)

2. **Completeness**: This repository contains **201 PDF documents** representing the complete, unaltered set of evidence collected across the evidentiary periods relevant to the above proceedings. No documents have been omitted, edited, or redacted except as required by law.

3. **Authenticity and Integrity**: Each document:
   - Originates from correspondence, notices, receipts, applications, or orders received by or issued by the relevant parties
   - Has been scanned or converted to PDF format without material alteration
   - Is stored with cryptographic hash verification (SHA256 and SHA512) to ensure tamper-detection and long-term integrity
   - Maintains original metadata (date, sender, subject) embedded in the filename and supporting CSV manifests

4. **Chain of Possession**: From collection date to present, these materials have remained:
   - Under my direct control and secure storage (encrypted local backup on macOS)
   - Backed up to this GitHub repository with Git version control and cryptographic commit hashing

## TECHNICAL VERIFICATION

### CRYPTOGRAPHIC INTEGRITY FRAMEWORK

**Hash Algorithm Standard**: NIST FIPS 180-4 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2 family)
- **SHA256**: 256-bit (32-byte) cryptographic hash; collision resistance suitable for forensic evidence integrity
- **SHA512**: 512-bit (64-byte) cryptographic hash; enhanced security margin for long-term archival

**Verification Procedure**:
Users can verify file integrity by downloading the PDF and computing its SHA256:
```bash
# macOS/Linux:
shasum -a 256 "filename.pdf"

# Windows PowerShell:
Get-FileHash -Path "filename.pdf" -Algorithm SHA256
```
Compare computed hash against value in APPENDIX A – SHA256_512.csv

**Result**: Match = File authentic; No match = Evidence of tampering
